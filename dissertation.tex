\section*{Abstract}
Software development continues to be a complex endeavor involving many disciplines and skill sets. Practitioners and researchers experiment, research, and adopt practices to simplify, understand, and create effective processes. 

Given the plethora of practices and methods, the Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) community created the Essence kernel as a unifying framework for describing and analyzing software engineering endeavors. 

My research goal is to evaluate the Essence kernel for practical use on academic and industrial software development projects, identify issues, and research solutions grounded in empirical evidence. 

At Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, I conducted a field study with masters of science in software engineering students as they completed team-based capstone projects using the Essence kernel. During weekly Essence Reflection meetings, the Essence kernel checklists helped students identify relevant goals to achieve, which enabled the team to steer the project to higher states. The student teams found value during project inception. However, teams found less value during the construction phase of iterative projects, as the Essence kernel offered few new goals hence loosing its ability to help the team steer the project. The original Essence kernel is method agnostic and does not directly support iterative development. Since most of agile software development occurs via iterative software development, adapting the Essence kernel to have goals for an iterative construction phase would increase its value to software development teams.

Following these results in academia, my objective is to continue my research in industry, with a focus on the practices at Pivotal. One of my next goals is to generate a process model that accurately describes iterative software projects at Pivotal. My plan is to conduct participant-observation of several software development projects at Pivotal. I will interview many software engineers and product managers to collect additional data. I'll iterate my research by incorporating this feedback. My expected result is a process model grounded in empirical data that supports iterative software development.
