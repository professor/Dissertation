\section*{Abstract}
\textit{Context:} Software development continues to be a complex socio-technical endeavor that involves coordinating different disciplines and skill sets. Practitioners and researchers experiment, research, and adopt practices to simplify, understand, and create effective processes. 
\textit{Objective:} The purpose of this research is to understand observed software development practices.
\textit{Method:} Following Constructivist Grounded Theory, I conducted a two-year five-month participant-observation of several software development projects at Pivotal, interviewed 26 software engineers, interaction designers, and product managers, and analyzed one year of retrospection topics. I iterated between analysis and theoretical sampling until achieving theoretical saturation.
\textit{Results:} 1) This research introduces a descriptive theory of Sustainable Software Development. The theory encompasses principles, policies, and practices aiming at removing knowledge silos and improving code quality (including discoverability and readability), hence leading to development sustainability. 2) At the heart of Sustainable Software Development is team code ownership. This research identified team code ownership as a feeling and identified five factors that affect ownership. Developers feel team code ownership more when they understand the system context, have contributed to the code in question, perceive code quality as high, believe the product will satisfy the user needs, and perceive high team cohesion. 3) This research introduces the first evidence-based waste taxonomy, identifying eight wastes along with causes and tensions within wastes. It also provides a comparison with the taxonomy of wastes found in Lean Software Development.  
\textit{Limitations:} While the results are highly relevant to Pivotal, the outcomes might not apply to organizations with different software development cultures.
\textit{Conclusion:} 
1) The Sustainable Software Development theory refines and extends our understanding of Extreme Programming by adding new principles, policies, and practices (including Overlapping Pair Rotation) and aligning them with the business goal of sustainability. 2) Team code ownership is rooted in numerous cognitive, emotional, contextual and technical factors and cannot be achieved simply by policy. 3) The waste taxonomy serves as a starting point for waste identification and elimination. Comparing this taxonomy to Lean Software Development's list of wastes revealed our taxonomy's parsimony and expressiveness while illustrating wastes not covered by previous work. 



%Given the plethora of practices and methods, the Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) community created the Essence kernel as a unifying framework for describing and analyzing software engineering endeavors. 

%My research goal is to evaluate the Essence kernel for practical use on academic and industrial software development projects, identify issues, and research solutions grounded in empirical evidence. 

%At Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, I conducted a field study with masters of science in software engineering students as they completed team-based capstone projects using the Essence kernel. During weekly Essence Reflection meetings, the Essence kernel checklists helped students identify relevant goals to achieve, which enabled the team to steer the project to higher states. The student teams found value during project inception. However, teams found less value during the construction phase of iterative projects, as the Essence kernel offered few new goals hence loosing its ability to help the team steer the project. The original Essence kernel is method agnostic and does not directly support iterative development. Since most of agile software development occurs via iterative software development, adapting the Essence kernel to have goals for an iterative construction phase would increase its value to software development teams.

%Following these results in academia, my objective is to continue my research in industry, with a focus on the practices at Pivotal. One of my next goals is to generate a process model that accurately describes iterative software projects at Pivotal. My plan is to conduct participant-observation of several software development projects at Pivotal. I will interview many software engineers and product managers to collect additional data. I'll iterate my research by incorporating this feedback. My expected result is a process model grounded in empirical data that supports iterative software development.

\chapter{Interview Drawings and Partial Transcriptions}
I asked many of the interviewees an open ended drawing question to begin a conversation by eliciting the their perspective on a topic. Here I include the diagrams with an abridged interview transcript where the interviewee describes their drawing.
